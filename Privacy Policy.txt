### Privacy Policy
#### 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application "Delete Photo & Video" (hereinafter referred to as the "App") developed and operated by [Your Developer Name/Team] (hereinafter referred to as the "Operator"). The App is a local photo/video management tool that focuses on privacy protection. All operations are completed offline on the user's device, and no user data is collected, uploaded, or shared. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

#### 2. Information Collection and Use
The App does not collect any personal information, photos, videos, device identifiers, or log data from users. All functions, including duplicate photo detection, batch deletion, and photo filtering, are processed locally on your device. No data will be transmitted to the Operator's server, cloud storage, or any third party.
- No collection of photos/videos: The App only accesses your device's photo library with your explicit authorization, and the access is limited to local processing (e.g., identifying duplicates, sorting by date/size). No photos or videos will be copied, stored, or uploaded.
- No collection of device information: The App does not obtain device identifiers (such as IDFA, IMEI), hardware models, operating system versions, or network information.
- No AI data training: If the App includes AI-powered duplicate detection, the AI algorithm runs locally on your device, and no data is used for model training or optimization.

#### 3. Data Storage and Security
All data processing results (such as deletion records) are stored only on your local device and are under your full control. The Operator has no access to or control over any data on your device.
- Data retention: The App does not retain any user data. Once you delete photos/videos through the App, the operation takes effect directly in your device's photo library, and no backup is kept by the App.
- Security protection: Since no data is transmitted or stored externally, the risk of data leakage is minimized. You can protect your data security by setting device locks, screen passwords, or other means.

#### 4. User Rights
You have the absolute right to control your data and the use of the App:
- Authorization management: You can enable or disable the App's access to the photo library at any time through your device settings (Settings > Privacy & Security > Photos).
- Data deletion: You can delete any photos/videos through the App, and the operation is irreversible (consistent with the system's native deletion logic).
- Opt-out right: You can uninstall the App at any time, and no residual data related to your personal information will be left on external servers.

#### 5. Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate any third-party SDKs, advertising services, analytics tools, or social sharing functions. Therefore, there is no scenario where user data is shared with third parties.

#### 6. Policy Updates
The Operator may update this Privacy Policy due to legal changes or functional adjustments. When an update occurs, we will notify you through in-App prompts or other reasonable means before the update takes effect. Your continued use of the App after the update constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
